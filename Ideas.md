Idea 1:
    • Title: Trends in energy consumption during the year (U.S)
    • Question: Are there certain seasons/months where more energy is consumed in the U.S?
    • Hypothesis: Energy consumption rises in Winter and Summer, and lowers in Autumn and Spring 
    • Data Source:
        ◦ https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/total-energy
        ◦ Will use years 2021 and before, since 2022 is currently in progress


Idea 2:
    • Title: Predicting Earnings/or Education (Global)
    • Question: What factors impact the amount a worker earns the most?
    • Notes: Could also ask if based on the indicators covered in the dataset, can our model (that we would build later) accurately predict the level of education completed?

Idea 3:
    • Title:
    • Question:
    • Hypothesis:
    • Data Source:



Strengths:
    • Pandas
    • Matplotlib and plotly? Maybe
    • Supervised Machine Learning

Weaknesses:
    • Functions
    • MongoDB
    • Any type of mapping


Interests:
    • Machine Learning
    • HTML with JavaScript
    • Cleaning Data
    • SQL









Project Requirements:
    • 2 publicly accessible datasets
    • more than 1,000 data points after ETL process
    • ETL on raw data and load into Database (SQL)
    • Implement ML on the data from the database
    • Git and branching strat
    • Published and accessible dashboard/viz to present
        ◦ Tableau
        ◦ GitHub pages (HTML, Javascript)
        ◦ Flask App hosted on Heroku
    • Project Pitch


Machine Learning Methods:
    1. Supervised
        1. Classification
        2. Regression
        3. For when we know what we’re looking for and what our output should be

    2. Unsupervised
        1. cluster or determine patterns in a grouping of data

    3. Deep Learning
        1. Maybe not the best for the final project, a bit too much.


Module 20: Final Project Roadmap

    • First Segment: Sketch It Out: Decide on your overall project, select your question, and build a simple model. You'll connect the model to a fabricated database, using comma-separated values (CSV) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files, to prototype your idea.
    • Second Segment: Build the Pieces: Train your model and build out the database you'll use for your final presentation.
    • Third Segment: Plug It In: Connect your final database to your model, continue to train your model, and create your dashboard and presentation.
    • Fourth Segment: Put It All Together: Put the final touches on your model, database, and dashboard. Lastly, create and deliver your final presentation to your class.
