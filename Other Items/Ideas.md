### Idea 1
- Title: Trends in energy consumption during the year (U.S)
- Question: Are there certain seasons/months where more energy is consumed in the U.S?
- Hypothesis: Energy consumption rises in Winter and Summer, and lowers in Autumn and Spring
- Data Source:
    - https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/total-energy
    - Will use years 2021 and before, since 2022 is currently in progress


### Idea 2
- Title: Predicting Earnings/or Education (Global)
- Question: What factors impact the amount a worker earns the most?
- Notes: Could also ask if based on the indicators covered in the dataset, can our model (that we would build later) accurately predict the level of education completed?

### Idea 3:
- Title: 
- Question: 
- Data Source: 



#### Strengths:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib and plotly? Maybe
- Supervised Machine Learning

#### Weaknesses:
- Functions
- MongoDB
- Any type of mapping


#### Interests:
- Machine Learning
- HTML with JavaScript
- Cleaning Data
- SQL

## Project Requirements:
- 2 publicly accessible datasets
- more than 1,000 data points after ETL process
- ETL on raw data and load into Database (SQL)
- Implement ML on the data from the database
- Git and branching strat
- Published and accessible dashboard/viz to present
    - Tableau
    - GitHub pages (HTML, Javascript)
    - Flask App hosted on Heroku
- Project Pitch



### Module 20: Final Project Roadmap

- **First Segment**: Sketch It Out: Decide on your overall project, select your question, and build a simple model. You'll connect the model to a fabricated database, using comma-separated values (CSV) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files, to prototype your idea.

- **Second Segment**: Build the Pieces: Train your model and build out the database you'll use for your final presentation.

- **Third Segment**: Plug It In: Connect your final database to your model, continue to train your model, and create your dashboard and presentation.

- **Fourth Segment**: Put It All Together: Put the final touches on your model, database, and dashboard. Lastly, create and deliver your final presentation to your class.
