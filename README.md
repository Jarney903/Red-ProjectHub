Final Project: N-Butane Recycle Build Up

Project Overview:

Purpose:

This analysis aims to provide insights and recommendations to Tower A, Tower B and Tower C, generating Model to accurately using principal component analysis,  neural networks to develop machine learning methods and piecewise linear regression to predict N-Butane Recycle Build Up. 


Background:
N-Butane is a colorless gas with an odor of Natural gas, is a Flammable Gas and a Dangerous Fire Hazard. N-Butane store in tightly closed containers in a cool, well-ventilated area away from HEAT. Store at temperatures bellow 125 F. This company need develop a real machine learning methods to handle issues in the towers and predict temperature to keep the community and the enviroment safe and recycle N-Butane effectively.


Analysis and Challenges

Analysis
The Analysis covers a Lab Data containing 1,203,246 Data Points (10 years records, temperature)

We are focusing on the last 10 years temperature records of N-Butane where we are observing the highest temperature and the lowest temperature per day to keep the towers out the dangerous temperature window and recycle N-Butane effectively.

Challenges
Some of the challenges encountered with the data was timestamp formats for N-Butane temperatures records and for us as a group decide what kind of machine learnig and cleaning data methods use for this project in order to have a better data view and generate Model accurate to contribute to this company success.
