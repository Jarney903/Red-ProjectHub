# Dashboard
## Purpose
- we want to display prediction of butane percent levels based on inputs of Tower A data (more ambitiously, Towers A, B, C and Reactor data). (Results)
- we want to display accuracy, margin of error, and confidence level of that prediction as well (Results)
- it may be nice to have separate tabs on the application to showcase the predictions, the learning models, documentation of our process, etc.
- we want everything to be visually digestible (we do not have the skills to make it visually appealing/sophisticated the same way an experienced developer can)
- ***IF*** possible and reasonable, it would be cool to at least partially develop a mockup of how this predictive analysis could be tweaked to generate as checkpoint data is input in realtime. We will not be able to test this with actual data for the scope of this project, however. 
- Questions:
    - we need it to work in reality, but can test without it working in reality
    - can test model against new data set
    - can test with data from july 16th until present (new test set)
